This is my first Next.js / Typescript project. 

My passion for running inspired me to play around with the Strava API. My goal was to display user data in a simple and clean way. That's why I used the bento design as it gives a sense of clarity and helps to organize elements well. 

For authentication, I utilized the NextAuth library, which made OAuth authentication straightforward through Providers. 

For charts, I used Recharts. 

For maps, I employed the react-leaflet library along with the Google Maps overlay for tiles.
